## Basic usage - Responsive breakpoint tester for Bootstrap 3

### Initialization
First you have to create an object instance. ResponsiveTester is a singleton class, so the constructor will always return the same object if is already created.
```javascript
$(function() {
    var screen = new ResponsiveTester();
    //...
});
```

### Checking current breakpoint
```javascript
if (screen.is('xs')) {
    // Executed only on xs breakpoint
}

if (screen.is('!=xs')) {
    // Executed on all breakpoints that are not equal xs (sm, md, lg)
}

if (screen.is('<md')) {
    // Executed on breakpoints that are smaller than md (xs, sm)
}

if (screen.is('<=md')) {
    // Executed on breakpoints that are smaller or equal to md (xs, sm, md)
}

if (screen.is('>md')) {
    // Executed on breakpoints that are larger than md (lg)
}

if (screen.is('>=md')) {
    // Executed on breakpoints that are larger or equal to md (md, lg)
}
```

### Events
```javascript
var $body = $('body');
$body.on('init.screen', function(event, devices) {
    // Code executed after plugin initialization
});

$body.on('change.screen', function(event, devices) {
    // Code executed when viewport was changed and reached breakpoint
});

$body.on('in.screen.xs', function(event, devices) {
    // Code executed when viewport is xs or was changed to xs
});

$body.on('out.screen.xs' + device, function(event, devices) {
    // Code executed when viewport is no longer xs
});
```

## Custom configuration
You can pass a configuration object when the instance is initialized
